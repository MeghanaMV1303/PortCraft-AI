## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to reflect the blend of creativity and technical skill the app provides. It will look great on a light or dark background.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0). Although almost white, this background offers a more comfortable reading experience than pure white. Also, subtle patterns, gradients and textures become more visible against this particular hue.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), 30 degrees from indigo, to highlight AI-driven features and call-to-action elements.
- Body text and Headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral and objective feel.
- Consistent use of flat, geometric icons that complement the selected color scheme, and highlight major functions like AI-based features.
- Clean and structured layout with clear sections for 'About Me,' 'Projects,' and 'Skills.'
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience.
